NEON carabid data are stored in three tables: field collection data, sorting data and pinning data. \r\n* Field collection data contains information related to the location of each trap (i.e., latitude, longitude, NLCD class) and metadata about the sampling event (i.e., when traps were set, 'setDate'; the date of trap collection, 'collectDate'; the number of days a given trap was in the field, 'daysOfTrapping'). Unique collection events have a unique sampleID (format = plotID.trapID.collectDate).\r\n\r\n\r\n* Sorting data contains information about what specimens were found in traps. Sample types include vertebrate bycatch (herptiles = 'vert bycatch herp'; mammals = 'vert bycatch mam'), non-Carabidae invertebrate bycatch (labelled 'invert bycatch'), and all information about carabids. Older data (2014 and prior) divide Carabid data into two categories: 'common carabid', for which all taxonomic and abundance data is listed in the sorting dataset, and 'other carabid', a catch-all category indicating that the relevant taxonomic and abundance information for specimens with that sampleID is provided in the pinning dataset. Unique records have a unique 'associatedSampleID' (format = plotID.trapID.collectDate.taxonID.tubeID; records where taxonomic information is unknown use shorthand codes based on sampleType-'ib' for invertebrate bycatch, 'vb' for vertebrate bycatch, 'cc' for common carabid, 'oc' for other carabid).\r\n\r\n* Pinning data contains information about all carabids that were pinned or pointed. Each sample in the pinning dataset has a unique identifier (individualID). The information in the pinning table are traceable to the sorting data via the a sampleID. Every 'sampleID' in the pinning data matches an 'associatedSampleID' in the sorting dataset. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
